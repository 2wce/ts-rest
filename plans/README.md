# Fork architecture and adoption work

Start with the [adapter epic](../docs/superpowers/plans/2026-11-04-adapter-maintenance-epic.md), [adoption backlog](../docs/release-readiness-backlog.md) and [adopted support policy](../docs/support-policy.md).

| Document                                                                                           | Purpose                                                                                    | Status                                                 |

Detailed plans exist for the response slices below. Future native-composition, upgrade and retirement slices require their own scoped designs and executable plans. [Merged PR #17](https://github.com/2wce/ts-restless/pull/17) owns plans 005/006, Next response adoption and the initial-v4 Next 15–16 baseline and associated execution records; it merged as `e937ed0e` on 2026-11-06. Its Next support decision and verification records are retained below.

## Response architecture work

These documents refine A04 and the response portions of A05/A06 in the existing adapter epic. Read the approved design and execution plan together. Implementation preserves current behavior; the client-policy correction in F04 and other host migrations remain separately scoped.

Plan 002 has three sequential tasks: characterize compatibility, establish the core capability and packed API evidence, then adopt it in Express and run the final gates. Original planning baseline: `aaae50b5`; delivery rebased onto `2bbc84e4` to exclude the already merged Changesets correction. Implemented on `feat/response-contract-evaluation`; all required local gates passed on 2026-11-06.

## Alternatives considered

- A monorepo directory relocation does not establish response ownership and is outside this slice.
- A universal host dispatcher would absorb native lifecycle responsibilities that remain adapter-owned.
- A selector-only utility does not consolidate response metadata and validation orchestration sufficiently.

## Execution evidence (2026-11-06)

- Compatibility checkpoint: `a15a7077` (originally `f35c9387`), 286 core/Express tests passed before production extraction; all nine inference tasks passed.
- Core capability checkpoint: `e763bd33` (originally `2826c302`), 266 core tests and all nine inference tasks passed. The first new evaluator run failed for the missing response module, then passed after implementation. Packed checks passed against real installed ESM/CommonJS exports and strict declarations.
- Completed adoption: 301 focused core/Express tests passed, including native JSON/text transform counts, stream bypass and existing middleware/conformance cases.
- Final `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` and `pnpm test:packages` all exited 0; the final packed suite passed 20 tests across four files. Changed-file formatting and whitespace checks passed.
- [PR #13](https://github.com/2wce/ts-restless/pull/13) merged as `d588e194` on 2026-11-06 after Build & Test, all ten compatibility fixtures and the aggregate compatibility gate passed. The fresh pre-PR source run passed 692 tests. No publication, dependency-floor change or host/client-policy migration is included.

The fresh worktree required `pnpm --filter @ts-restless/core build` before the existing non-strict inference fixture could resolve its declaration path. No configuration or schema-primitive changes were needed. Subagent dispatch did not deliver readable instructions, so execution and diff review used the user's selected single-executor workflow with checkpoints.

## Fastify response adoption evidence (2026-11-06)

Plan 003 is implemented on `feat/fastify-response-evaluation`, rebased onto main commit `333cbee3`, which includes merged A04 and the prerelease versions. Fastify now uses the same core evaluation result for validation, no-body handling and explicit media types. Its native hooks, serialization, error identity and existing stream validation policy are preserved.

Local gates passed: 350 focused tests, 700 full-source tests, all nine inference tasks, Fastify source/test typing, 20 packed tests in four files, changed-file formatting/whitespace and targeted lint (one existing warning). The compatibility checkpoint proved the tests detect an inverted validation policy. Real packed ESM/CommonJS adapters execute transforming responses under all four validator profiles. See [plan 003](003-fastify-response-evaluation.md#execution-evidence) for details and the local runtime version.

A05 remains partial: response adoption merged in [PR #14](https://github.com/2wce/ts-restless/pull/14) as `b4a15042` after Build & Test, all ten compatibility fixtures and the aggregate gate passed. Request adoption depends on unimplemented A03. Nest/serverless response adoption and the client-policy correction remain separate slices.

## Public-only release tracking (2026-11-06)

[Plan 004](004-private-package-release-noise.md) implements the user's private-package policy in the same PR #14: one fixed group of ten explicit public libraries, with private versioning and tagging disabled. All nine real Changesets release probes and the 21-test packed suite passed. Existing private versions/prestate are retained; no live publication occurs in the probes. The prerelease checklist records the separate stable-exit rehearsal for the installed planner's skipped-package edge case.

[PR #15](https://github.com/2wce/ts-restless/pull/15) merged as `aed1a973` after the same CI gates passed. It removes the private v5 helper from a retained mixed Changeset and makes the current-state version probe retain every committed Changeset. The probe reproduced the action's mixed-entry failure before the correction. Release PR #16 and the dated registry snapshot establish alpha.1 publication; stable publication remains unperformed. Release/publication status remains separate from architecture delivery.

## Next response adoption evidence (2026-11-06)

[Plan 005](005-next-response-evaluation.md) extends the shared response capability to the native Next API adapter on `feat/next-response-evaluation`, rebased onto alpha release main `a708f059`. Both router and single-route handlers retain their native writes, status coercion, original request/response context and error callbacks. Request validation and routing stay at their existing boundaries.

Compatibility checkpoint `965e64f5` adds 28 cases across both entry points. All 60 Next tests passed before adoption; temporarily inverting validation produced 14 expected failures. Adoption checkpoint `ce4c963f` passed 326 core/Next tests and Next source/test typing. Full `pnpm check` passed 728 source tests and all configured typechecks, with zero lint errors and the existing 393 warnings; it passed again on pinned Node 26.12.0 after the packed-fixture correction.

At checkpoint `85b102ce`, all 21 packed tests passed on Node 26.12.0 with Next 12.3.7 declarations and Next 16.4.2 runtime execution. [CI](https://github.com/2wce/ts-restless/actions/runs/42228417004) passed Build & Test (including canonical example builds), all ten compatibility fixtures and the aggregate gate. That temporary Next 12 declaration baseline is superseded by plan 006 below. A06 remains partial until A03 and Next request adoption are implemented.

## Initial Next support baseline (2026-11-06)

The user approved dropping upstream-unsupported Next majors from the first stable v4 baseline. [Plan 006](006-next-supported-majors.md) narrows Next and serverless peers to `^15.0.0 || ^16.0.0`, matching the [official LTS policy](https://nextjs.org/support-policy). The existing Next 16 example is retained; Pages Router style does not imply an unsupported Next major.

All 25 packed/release tests passed on Node 26.12.0, covering Next 15.5.29 and 16.4.2 across four validator profiles, native Pages API HTTP and serverless NextRequest execution, and both module formats. Strict checking reports only exact reviewed upstream diagnostics; every other error fails. A deliberately incorrect handler type caused two expected failures and passed after restoration. The initial peer baseline failed against old archives before the manifests changed. Full `pnpm check` passed 728 tests and all configured typechecks, with zero lint errors and 393 existing warnings. [CI for implementation `0a7bdb66`](https://github.com/2wce/ts-restless/actions/runs/42236967009) passed Build & Test, all ten compatibility fixtures and the aggregate gate. PR #17 merged as `e937ed0e` on 2026-11-06. No publication was part of that change.
